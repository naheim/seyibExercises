# Peer Review Proposals

In this lab, you will review a copy of two different peers' proposals. You will give them a copy of your review, and also give me a summary of your review (see Part I). 

You will also recieve reviews on your proposal from two of your peers. You will give me a summary of those reviews and how you plan to address their comments (see Part II).

## Part I

Summarize the review and comments you gave to your peer. You will need to do this for each proposal that you review (i.e., twice). Be sure to state the name of the person you are reviewing.

#### Queston 1
Did you feel that the proposal you graded was complete in terms of length, and that it demonstrated a genuine effort on your peer's part. If not, explain what you felt was lacking.

#### Question 2
Briefly summarize the overarching objective and hypothesis of the reviewed proposal. 

#### Question 3
Does the hypothesis meet the following criteria in your estimation? If not, explain why.

+ Do you believe that this hypothesis is coherent and understandable?
+ Do you believe that this hypothesis is novel?
+ Do you believe that this hypothesis is testable/feasible?
+ Do you believe that this hypothesis is scientifically or socially relevant?

#### Question 4
Summarize the areas where you felt that the proposal could be improved.

#### Question 5
What constructive criticism did you provide to your peer to address the areas that needed improvement?

#### Question 6
Did you feel that this proposal made an adequate use of citation and background research? If not, what additional information did you want to see?

## Part II

Summarize your response to your peers' reviews of your proposal. You will need to do this once for each review you recieve. State who was your reviewer.

#### Question 1
Did the reviewer clearly understand your hypothesis? If not, what will you do to make it clearer?

#### Question 2
Did the reviewer feel that your proposed project was scientifically or socially relevant? If not, how will you improve it?

#### Question 3
Did the reviewer approve of your proposed analytical methods? If not, how will you improve them?

#### Question 4
Do you feel that your reviewer did an adequate and thorough job in their review? How could they have improved their review?

#### Question 5
In general, what steps will you now take to improve your proposal?
