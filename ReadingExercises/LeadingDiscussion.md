# Leading Reading Discussion

Interns will be incharge of leading our discussions of Bonner's *Why Size Matters*. For each discussion, a pair of interns will lead the discussion. The discussion is meant to be among the interns and not simply a chance for me to answer questions or give insights from on-high.  ***Everyone needs to read the capaters in detail, not just the disucssion leaders.***

## Goals of a discussion
* A broad goal is to understand the point of each chapter.
* The goal of a whole book is to understand how why scientists find body size so interesting, what we still have to learn about body size, and to insipire scientific crativety in you around body size research.
* To practice public speaking and leading a discussion!

## How NOT to lead a discussion
* Start off with a monologue that takes up most of the time, so there isn’t actually any time for discussion.
* Tell your fellow students what the chapters are about, by going through nearly every paragraph in detail.
* Ask for feedback on every minute detail: e.g., What was this about? What was that about? What did you think about that? How do you feel about his comment? and on and on.
*End Result:* If this is what you do, at the end of the discussion, the interns participating in the discussion will be no better informed, having gained no better understanding, of what the chapter was all about. The interns won't "see the forest for the trees." The key points and argumentation will be lost in a morass of blinding detail relating to statistics, procedures, and so on.

####Leading a good discussion is not as easy as it looks. It requires quite a bit of planning and an understanding of group dynamics.

####Don't assume that discussions lead themselves, or that your fascinating subject matter guarantees success.

## Preparing for the Disucssion
1. **Read.** Read the chapter a couple of times, if necessary, to grasp the concepts and be familiar with content. Seek help with ideas you do not understand. Consult literature that is cited, or other material that will enhance understanding of the topic. Be sure to understand the basic operation of the system under consideration, even if it is necessary to consult texts, additional articles, other interns, or your mentor. Look for material or examples that help expand the applicability or generality of the ideas or system under consideration.

2. **Plan the discussion.** Be prepared to lead the discussion by asking questions. Plan the questions, structuring them so as to achieve the discussion goals. The most important prerequisite to leading a successful discussion is preparation.

3. You will be leading a discussion along with another intern, so you will need to get together ahead of time to develop a plan of how to proceed. Time will be provided.

## Leading the Discussion

1. **Provide a quick (no more than 5 minute) summary of the chpater:**

   In most cases, you want to first provide the audience a brief but accurate overview of the chapter. This summary should focus on the Research Questions / Hypothesis. After providing the broader context, you should quickly go over the main methods, and the key results (e.g., figures/tables). You should act as a guide for your audience, and take them through the key results. Try not to spend a lot of time on more trivial aspects of a chapter. In general, your summary should not delve too deeply in the discussion/interpretation of the content presented in the chapter.

   *Don’t forget:* you are assuming everyone in the room has read the chapter, so your overall introduction should be relatively short (no more than 5 minutes). More time may be required if a concept or methodological approach is particularly complex. Try not to provide opinions or critiques of the chapter at this point in time – save this for the general discussion.

2. **Ask for points of clarification:**

   Before proceeding with detailed discussion of the chapter, you should ask the audience if they require clarification on anything in the chapter. You are leading a discussion and therefore considered an ‘expert’ on the chapter, and as such, should be prepared to handle these points of clarification – this will may require you to do a bit of research on areas of the chapter that you do not understand!  It’s important you you make it clear that you are not starting a detailed critique (yet); you are first making sure that people all understand the critical ‘nuts and bolts’ of the chapter.

3. **Leading a discussion:**

   The majority of the time should be spent on the actual discussion.  There are many ways to do this, but here are some tips:

   * Try not to let your own opinion of the chapter distract or take over – your goal is to get other people to reveal their own views; these may or may not agree with your own views! Be welcoming and accommodating to other people’s opinions and viewpoints. Never make anyone feel small or stupid, even if they make a goofy mistake.

   * That being said, make sure that you do have an opinion, and be willing to share it at some point.

   * Prepare a list of questions that you could ask other people if the discussion needs help to get started. Always try to find positive points in a chapter, even if the chapter is, overall, very weak. Similarly, try to bring out negative features even if the chapter is strong.  This means you have to sort out strong and negative parts of a chapter for yourself (well ahead of time).
   * It’s sometimes a good idea to first go around the room and ask for something that people felt was strong and positive about the chapter, and then do this again but ask for points of constructive criticism about the chapter.
Don’t hesitate to ask people (specifically) for their views on some sections of this chapter: a gentle push may be needed to get started on discussing the specifics, but this can be fruitful.

   * Since you are chairing the discussion, don’t be afraid to take control if the discussion wanders too far from where it needs to be, and/or if the discussion gets too trivial or mired in the weeds. Related, whenever possible, draw the discussion back to the actual research objectives, and try to broaden the discussion out to the overarching concenptual framework: are the results generalizable to other fields? Does the chapter make broad and meaningful conclusions that will be long-lived and significant?

   * Towards the end of the discussion, it may be useful to ask people how they might have done the work differently. Or, stated another way, what could have been improved? You could also ask what questions were raised that people might want to do further research on to better understand.

4. **Summarize the discussion:**

   Spend the last five minutes of your time reminding people about the actual objectives, and provide a concise summary of the discussion that just wrapped up. Do this in an inclusive way, and give a nod to everyone in the room: make everyone feel that their points of views and opinions are taken seriously.   Try to get an overall consensus about the general quality of the chapter, and one litmus test may be whether or not you would cite the chapter in your own work.
   
## Sample Questions (definitely come up with other on your own)

Focus on a small set of questions (e.g. 2-3 per chapter) that will help steer the group to the points you find most interesting and useful about the chapter. These might include questions such as:

* What point was the author trying to make? Did he/she make his point?

* Are all of the results obtained consistent with the hypothesis being tested?

* What sort of evidence would make the author's case stronger? What sort of evidence would argue against the author? What case would a skeptical scientist make against the author's interpretation of their results?

* Do all of the conclusions drawn make sense based on the results? What evidence did the author cite in favor of his/her claims? Did the author provide substantive support for their position? Which conclusions are directly drawn from the analysis of the results, and which are more speculative?

* Don't ask yes-or-no questions or questions with obvious factual answers.

**As a discussion leader, make sure that you have thought about possible answers to each question you pose to the group!**
